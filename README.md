#### Note this plan is flexible as far as food goes. I do not know how much we all like to eat and spend. Around day 3 if we have spent more than half of our ~$1200 food budget we will eat cheaper, at the shopping area that Qdoba is located. We have a list of food options.
#### Everything is very close to Evergreen lodge, so driving time is negligible and gas cost while there should be very minimal.
